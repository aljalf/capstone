Capstone Project Work

CSVs are samples of data I would use in capstone.

* stations.csv = geographical coordinates of groundwater measurement stations (wells) throughout California

* measurements-sample.csv = periodic measurements at each well from stations.csv over many years (this is a subset of the total data)

* noaa-rain-sample.csv = a sample of rainfall data from specific geographical coordinates. This data is from just one reporting station but there are many throughout the state

The plan is to predict groundwater levels based on rainfall levels.

Station and Measurement data is from CA Department of Water Resources.
Precipitation data is from NOAA
